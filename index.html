    Hey nims, if you're reading this it means you miss me <br>
    Just know that I miss you too... alot <br>
    We fought and you said you don't want me and I'm going to respect that <br>
    Cuz ur right about everything, about how I always expect you to come back to me <br>
    Truth is I expected that cuz that's my way of proving to myself that you actually want me <br>
    I know it's fucked up but there's things you did I didn't like <br>
    But I pushed it under the carpet as usual and whenever I mentioned anything that bothered me you'd disregard it. <br>
    Khair, there was so much going on with me which is why I ran away <br>
    Ur right, I shouldn't have but that's just my  reflex to every bad situation cuz I don't wanna get hurt so I just isolate myself <br><br>
    Anyways, ur mine nims and you always will be <br>
    Just please forgive me if I ever hurt you, I don't want you to cuss me out or say bad things about me ever<br><br>
    
    Love you forever, your silly billy

      I thought I'd explain the song....<br>
      Yes the song is exactly how I feel, that's why I wanted you to see the lyrics cuz if I were to say something to you it'd be that.<br>
      About the whole leaving thing, yes I've thought of just stopping talking to you cuz yk how I am once something ends,<br>
      I stop talking to you completely no snaps no texting no streaks, cuz for my own happiness and to move on I like to just forget<br>
      about it and that's how I do it, me personally.<br>
      I don't wanna lose you<br>
      No I don't wanna leave cuz ur my home, but with everything that's happened during the past week I think a part of me has left<br>
      The lovey dovey me, I just want you to know you can get him back cuz you know how to if you really still have feelings for me.<br>
      Thank you for loving me and letting me love you back too, I was a different kind of happy with you and I want that back.<br>
      Thank you for letting me experience it with you, and like the song said, don't ever forget everything that I told you.<br>
      Don't forget how I treated you and everything I did and told you, never forget that.<br>
      Like I said earlier, focus on yourself rn ur going through a lot, don't think about me, I'm always here. I'll always stay baby.<br>
      Even if we stop talking I'm still here, cuz I feel like I am getting distant and far which explains me being distant through text too,<br>
      and there is a possibilty we might stop talking.<br>
      Whenever this is over and when you feel better and when things will get better, cuz they will, tell me ur ready for me, lemme know<br>
      I'll be waiting on the other side, and hold ur hand through this side too. I'll be with you through ur lows and highs and you know that<br>
      You'll never find anyone like me, the way I feel for you and care about every single piece of you, cuz ik what I'm willing to do for you.<br>
      Whenever ur sad or down call me please yk you can count on me, I'll take care of you like no one else<br>
      I want you, and the fact you wanna work it out later whenever ur ready is the hope I have. Like I always say monkey, never lose hope.<br>
      I hope you still trust me and tell me everything cuz that's what I want and how I like it.<br>
      I feel like you don't tell me much anymore, ur secrets, stuff about you and what's going on yk. It kinda makes me sad.
    </p>

    <p>
      <h4><u>Read this whenever you feel down and don't feel like talking:</h4></u>
      I'm smiling rn cuz we just talked on the phone and just hearing your voice makes me happy<br>
      You make me smile and make my mood so much better and we both freaky asf so that's a bonus<br>
      YOU MATTER, and I CARE about YOU, I will ALWAYS be here for you, till the end, I'm coming for you<br>
      Focus on yourself and you will be happier, love yourself and treat yourself w love, you have to figure it out by yourself,<br>
      but I will be by your side cuz we all need a shoulder to lay on cuz it's exhausting and lemme be that for you.<br>
      After a long day, I want you to come to me and just be able to relax and release all the stress and tension w me together.<br>
      Never give up and I'm sorry if I ever am a burden to you in any way.<br>
      I want you to focus on you and you only for now, and I'll be right here with you through it and at the end too, pinky promise.
